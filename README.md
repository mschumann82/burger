# burger

Eat Dat Burger is an application that allows the user to "eat" a burger, add a burger, and view the burgers they have eaten. I went with a ketchup and mustard color scheme since we are talking burgers.

Technologies used:

Node.js
Javascript
Jquery
Mysql
CSS
npm packages: mysql, body-parser, express, express-handlebars

How to use:

To eat a burger you simply click on the Eat Dis button next to the burger you wish to eat.

To add a burger you simply type in the name of the burger you want to add to the list and then click the add burger button.

You can view the burgers that have already been eaten on the right.
